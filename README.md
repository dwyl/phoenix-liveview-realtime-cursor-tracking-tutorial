# `Phoenix LiveView` Realtime Cursor Tracking Tutorial

Learn how to create a **simple cursor tracking app** using **Phoenix LiveView** </br>
and _learn_ it step-by-step!

</div>

# Why? ðŸ¤·

As we're building our [MVP](https://github.com/dwyl/mvp),
we are always trying to leverage the _awesome_ real-time
features of `Phoenix` and `LiveView`. 

Live cursor tracking will enable _us_ to create a
team-friendly environment in w hich users will _know_
what the others are doing.

# What? ðŸ’­

This tutorial creates a stylized simple landing page
showing the cursor of everyone that is connected
to it. It should take you no more than 20 minutes
to get up and running!

# Who? ðŸ‘¤

This tutorial is aimed at LiveView beginners 
who want to understand the ins and outs, while 
sparkling a bit of [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
magic :sparkles:.

If you are completely new to Phoenix and LiveView,
we recommend you follow the **LiveView _Counter_ Tutorial**:
https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-counter-tutorial

### Prerequisites 
This tutorial requires you have `Elixir` and `Phoenix` installed.
If you you don't, please see [how to install Elixir](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-elixir#installation)
and [Phoenix](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/installation.html#phoenix).

# How? ðŸ’»

## Step 0: Run the finished app locally
To get a feel of what you are going to build and
to be _make sure_ it's working in 1 minute, do the
following steps:

### Clone the repo
Run the following commands to clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/dwyl/phoenix-liveview-realtime-cursor-tracking-tutorial.git
cd phoenix-liveview-realtime-cursor-tracking-tutorial
```

### Download the Dependencies

Install the dependencies by running the command:

```sh
mix setup
```

This will download dependencies and
compile your files. It might take a few
minutes!

### Run the App

Start the Phoenix server by running the command:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

Now you can visit
[`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000)
in your web browser.

> ðŸ’¡ Open a _second_ browser window or tab
>  (**in incognito mode**, if you want to),
> and you will see the a new cursor with a new name!

## 1. Create the App ðŸ†•

In your terminal run the following `mix` command
to generate the new Phoenix app:

```sh
mix phx.new live_cursors --no-ecto
```

This command will setup the dependencies (including the liveView dependencies)
and boilerplate for us a Phoenix project without
a database. 

When you see the following prompt in your terminal, 
press `Y` to install the dependencies.

```sh
Fetch and install dependencies? [Yn]
```

Type <kbd>Y</kbd> followed by the <kbd>Enter</kbd> key.
That will download all the necessary dependencies.

### 1a. Setting up TailwindCSS
We are going to be using TailwindCSS to style our page. 
If this is the first time using TailwindCSS, you 
can check [our tutorial](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-tailwind)
for a primer. 

The reason we are using TailwindCSS is to showcase you
how to also integrate a *mature* styling library and
get it running with Phoenix so you can create your 
own awesome and beautiful web pages :smile:.

#### Installing TailwindCSS
Let's first add the TailwindCSS dependency to our project,
by opening the `mix.exs` file and adding
the following line to the `deps` section:

```elixir
{:tailwind, "~> 0.1.9", runtime: Mix.env() == :dev},
```

Next, in the `config/config.exs` file, 
let's specify the Tailwind version we are 
going to be using.

```elixir
config :tailwind,
  version: "3.2.0",
  default: [
      args: ~w(
      --config=tailwind.config.js
      --input=css/app.css
      --output=../priv/static/assets/app.css
      ),
      cd: Path.expand("../assets", __DIR__)
  ]
```

Now, simply run the following command to install
the dependency:


```sh
mix deps.get
```

And then run the following Tailwind tasks. These 
will download the standalone Tailwind CLI and 
generate a `tailwind.config.js` file
in the `./assets` directory.

```sh
mix tailwind.install
mix tailwind default
```

#### Setup watcher, minification and loading Tailwind
Throughout development we want Tailwind CLI 
to track our files for changes. For this, add
the following watcher in `config/dev.exs` file.

```elixir
  watchers: [
    //...
    tailwind: {Tailwind, :install_and_run, [:default, ~w(--watch)]},
  ]
```

After developing our application, we want tailwind to 
minify our CSS files in production. For this to happen,
update the following line in the `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
  defp aliases do
    [
      setup: ["deps.get"],
      "assets.deploy": ["esbuild default --minify", "tailwind default --minify", "phx.digest"]
    ]
  end
```

All we have to do now is make sure tailwind classes
are loaded in our `assets/css/app.css`. The tasks
you ran previously probably already took care of this,
but make sure you have these added to your file.

```elixir
@import "tailwindcss/base";
@import "tailwindcss/components";
@import "tailwindcss/utilities";

//@import "./phoenix.css";   -> deleted
```

Also make sure your `assets/js/app.js`
was changed as well. Make sure the 
`import "../css/app.css";` line is commented
or removed.

After all of this, you should be done! You can 
start styling your webpages with some sweet CSS :tada:.

### 1b. Running the Phoenix app
To make sure everything is working properly, 
run the following:

```sh
mix phx.server
```

If you visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000), you'll
see the following in your browser.

<img width="1379" alt="phoenix_with_tailwind" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/197478954-a4ce8e52-8a14-45c5-b80a-883639c5f1f6.png">

> Don't worry if this looks ugly. It's because
we now use TailwindCSS. We're going to make it
pretty in the next few minutes!

## 2. LiveView with cursors 
Let's start by adding a LiveView to our application. 
Let's switch the current default route to a new 
`live` route in the `lib/live_cursors_web/router.ex` file.

```elixir
  scope "/", LiveCursorsWeb do
    pipe_through :browser
    live "/", Cursors
  end
```

Next, we create a `live` folder in `lib/live_cursors_web/live`,
and create a file called `cursors.ex` with the following code.
We are placing assigning `x` and `y` to the socket, 
which will refer to the mouse position within the page.

```elixir
defmodule LiveCursorsWeb.Cursors do
    use LiveCursorsWeb, :live_view

    def mount(_params, _session, socket) do
      {:ok, 
        socket
          |> assign(:x, 50)
          |> assign(:y, 50)
      }
    end
end
```

In the same folder, we create a `cursors.html.heex` file with the
follow code:

```
<ul class="list-none">
    <li style={"left: #{@x}%; top: #{@y}%"} class="flex flex-col absolute pointer-events-none whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="31" height="32" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 31 32">
        <path fill="url(#a)" d="m.609 10.86 5.234 15.488c1.793 5.306 8.344 7.175 12.666 3.612l9.497-7.826c4.424-3.646 3.69-10.625-1.396-13.27L11.88 1.2C5.488-2.124-1.697 4.033.609 10.859Z"/>
        <defs>
          <linearGradient id="a" x1="-4.982" x2="23.447" y1="-8.607" y2="25.891" gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
            <stop style={"stop-color: #5B8FA3"}/>
            <stop offset="1" stop-color="#BDACFF"/>
          </linearGradient>
        </defs>
      </svg>
    </li>
</ul>
```

> The reason we have the HTML template on a different file
instead of using the `render` function with the `~H` sigil
is purely for dev experience purposes. With VS Code, 
we can get TailwindCSS hints and code completion
which we wouldn't otherwise using a `render` function 
in the `cursors.ex` file.

Now delete all the code in the 
`lib/live_cursors_web/templates/page/index.html.heex` 
and change the `lib/live_cursors_web/templates/layout/root.html.heex` file. 
We just delete the header 
and render the content on our `cursors.html.heex` file.

```elixir
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/>
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"/>
    <meta name="csrf-token" content={csrf_token_value()}>
    <%= live_title_tag assigns[:page_title] || "LiveCursors", suffix: " Â· Phoenix Framework" %>
    <link phx-track-static rel="stylesheet" href={Routes.static_path(@conn, "/assets/app.css")}/>
    <script defer phx-track-static type="text/javascript" src={Routes.static_path(@conn, "/assets/app.js")}></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= @inner_content %>
  </body>
</html>
```

You should now see a cursor 
at the middle of the page.

<img width="1379" alt="simple_cursor_middle" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/197489203-ce81beea-d30a-4aa2-948d-cb63635cae19.png">


> You can change your `svg` object to anything you like. 
> This custom cursor was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/).


### 2a. Tracking cursor movement
We are going to use Javascript 
to track the mouse movement on the client 
and send it over to the Phoenix server 
we are building. 

We understand that the idea of LiveView 
is to do as much work on the server as possible, 
but in this specific scenario, that is not possible.

Phoenix offers 
[options for client/server interoperability](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix_live_view/js-interop.html), 
including **client hooks**. 
We are using the `phx-hook` binding for this. 
We are going to send events from Javascript 
to the server through this binding. 

In this case, we are using the `mousemove` 
event to send the updated coordinates to 
the server. 
For this, add the following code in the `assets/js/app.js`.

```javascript
let Hooks = {};

Hooks.TrackClientCursor = {
  mounted() {
    document.addEventListener('mousemove', (e) => {
      const mouse_x = (e.pageX / window.innerWidth) * 100; // in %
      const mouse_y = (e.pageY / window.innerHeight) * 100; // in %
      this.pushEvent('cursor-move', { mouse_x, mouse_y });
    });
  }
};

let csrfToken = document.querySelector("meta[name='csrf-token']").getAttribute("content")
let liveSocket = new LiveSocket("/live", Socket, {hooks: Hooks, params: {_csrf_token: csrfToken}})
```

In the previous code block, 
we track the mouse position within the page in percentage. 
This way, the mouse position 
is displayed correctly in any device. 

The `mousemove` event handler 
is added to the `Hook` object which,
 in turn, is passed through the `liveSocket`.

After this, we need to *handle the event* in the
`cursors.ex` file. Let's add the event handler with
the following code:

```elixir
  def handle_event("cursor-move", %{"mouse_x" => x, "mouse_y" => y}, socket) do
    {:noreply,
      socket
        |> assign(:x, x)
        |> assign(:y, y)
    }
  end
```

In the `cursors.html.heex` file, 
let's change the first two lines with the
following piece of code:

```
<ul class="list-none mt-9 max-h-full max-w-full" id="cursor" phx-hook="TrackClientCursor">
    <li style={"left: #{@x}%; top: #{@y}%"} class="flex flex-col absolute pointer-events-none whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden">
```

Here, we are using the `phx-hook` binding 
with the hook created in the `app.js` file.
Make sure to ann an `id` to the element so that LiveView 
can properly identify it.

If you restart the server and open the browser again,
the cursor should follow your mouse movements.

<img width="1379" alt="cursor_tracking" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/197502086-f3a0ff05-5604-41ce-ad4f-3a72b05d8414.png">


## 3. Adding users
We have our own mouse cursor moving. We need to 
*broadcast* this movement information to every user
that joins the channel. Additionally, we need to 
identify who in the channel so we show their respective
cursor with their name.

In our application, whenever a user visits the website,
a session will be created and we'll assign a random
username to the user who joined. 

### 3a. Adding usernames
To generate random names, we'll be using the 
[mnemonic_slugs](https://github.com/devshane/mnemonic_slugs) 
library. To do this, let's install it. 
Add the following line to the `mix.exs` file.

```elixir
{:mnemonic_slugs, "~> 0.0.3"},
```

and run the command below to install it.

```sh
mix deps.get
```

We then change our `cursors.ex` file to 
*create* a new username to the person joining
the page and add it to the socket assigns.
Your `mount/3` function should now look
like this.

```elixir
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do

    username = MnemonicSlugs.generate_slug

    {:ok,
      socket
        |> assign(:x, 50)
        |> assign(:y, 50)
        |> assign(:username, username)
    }
  end
```

Now let's show this username! Head to
`cursors.html.heex` and let's add a simple
`<span>` with the `@username` assign we just 
added to the socket. The file should look
like this.

```elixir
<ul class="list-none mt-9 max-h-full max-w-full" id="cursor" phx-hook="TrackClientCursor">
    <li style={"left: #{@x}%; top: #{@y}%"} class="flex flex-col absolute pointer-events-none whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="31" height="32" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 31 32">
        <path fill="url(#a)" d="m.609 10.86 5.234 15.488c1.793 5.306 8.344 7.175 12.666 3.612l9.497-7.826c4.424-3.646 3.69-10.625-1.396-13.27L11.88 1.2C5.488-2.124-1.697 4.033.609 10.859Z"/>
        <defs>
          <linearGradient id="a" x1="-4.982" x2="23.447" y1="-8.607" y2="25.891" gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
            <stop style={"stop-color: #5B8FA3"}/>
            <stop offset="1" stop-color="#BDACFF"/>
          </linearGradient>
        </defs>
      </svg>
          
      <span class="mt-1 ml-4 px-1 text-sm text-white rounded-xl bg-slate-600">
        <%= @username %>
      </span>
    </li>
</ul>
```


If you restart the server and open the browser, 
you will see the cursor and a random username
moving along with it.

<img width="1379" alt="cursor_with_username" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/197506546-2208c9ee-6f36-4625-b49b-126eef60d629.png">

### 3b. Tracking who is online
This is the most exciting part of the tutorial. 
We are going to have different users have their 
cursors and see them in real-time! For this, we
need to be able to track *who is online in
the channel*. For this, we are going to be
using **Phoenix Presence**. We will use Presence
to store information about the *coordinates* and *username* in the Presence channel. 

> Phoenix Presence is a package within the Phoenix
ecosystem that allows us to track processes and users
that are within a channel. It provides many features.
We recommend reading [their documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Phoenix.Presence.html)
if you are interested in learning more.

Let's start by adding PResence
to our application. Run the following command.

```sh
mix phx.gen.presence
```

After installing, the terminal should ask you to 
follow some instructions. 

```sh
Add your new module to your supervision tree,
in lib/live_cursors/application.ex:

    children = [
      ...
      LiveCursorsWeb.Presence
    ]
```

Let's follow the instructions and do 
exactly that. Open `lib/live_cursors/application.ex`
and add `LiveCursorWeb.Presence` to the `children` array.

With Presence installed, let's now work on 
the `cursors.ex` file. First, let's add 
`alias LiveCursorsWeb.Presence` 
after declaring the module so it's easier
to write our code.

In the `mount/3` function, we will initialize Presence
for the channel through the `Presence.track/4` function. 
We will define a constant `@channel_topic`
and use it in the function as well. Change the
code in `cursors.ex` file so the mounting function
looks like such:

```elixir
defmodule LiveCursorsWeb.Cursors do
  alias LiveCursorsWeb.Presence
  use LiveCursorsWeb, :live_view

  @channel_topic "cursor_page"

  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do

    username = MnemonicSlugs.generate_slug

    Presence.track(self(), @channel_topic, socket.id, %{
      socket_id: socket.id,
      x: 50,
      y: 50,
      username: username,
    })

    LiveCursorsWeb.Endpoint.subscribe(@channel_topic)

    initial_users =
      Presence.list(@channel_topic)
      |> Enum.map(fn {_, data} -> data[:metas] |> List.first() end)

    updated =
      socket
      |> assign(:username, username)
      |> assign(:users, initial_users)
      |> assign(:socket_id, socket.id)

    {:ok, updated}
  end
```

To further explain what we just wrote, 
we are telling Presence to track ourselves, within
the channel, the `id` of the socket and adding 
metadata we want to track, namely the `username` 
and the mouse coordinates (`x` and `y`). 
Additionally, whenever the user acecss the page, 
it **subscribes** to the channel events 
in the `LiveCursorsWeb.Endpoint.subscribe(@channel_topic)`. 
After this, we create an `initial_users` variable, 
where we use the data from Presence and obtain the list of
connected users and their respective metadata. 
At last, we assign the `user` data 
and the `initial_users` 
and `socket.id` data to the socket assigns, 
so we can access this information 
in the `cursors.html.heex` file.

Speaking of which, let's change the `cursors.html.heex` file
to reflect these changes. We are going to iterate over
the list of users that are online and render a cursor and name
for each one. Your file should now look like the following:

```elixir
<ul class="list-none mt-9 max-h-full max-w-full" id="cursor" phx-hook="TrackClientCursor">
  <%= for user <- @users do %>
    <li style={"left: #{user.x}%; top: #{user.y}%"} class="flex flex-col absolute pointer-events-none whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden">
      <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="31" height="32" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 31 32">
        <path fill="url(#a)" d="m.609 10.86 5.234 15.488c1.793 5.306 8.344 7.175 12.666 3.612l9.497-7.826c4.424-3.646 3.69-10.625-1.396-13.27L11.88 1.2C5.488-2.124-1.697 4.033.609 10.859Z"/>
        <defs>
          <linearGradient id="a" x1="-4.982" x2="23.447" y1="-8.607" y2="25.891" gradientUnits="userSpaceOnUse">
            <stop style={"stop-color: #5B8FA3"}/>
            <stop offset="1" stop-color="#BDACFF"/>
          </linearGradient>
        </defs>
      </svg>
      <span class="mt-1 ml-4 px-1 text-sm text-white rounded-xl bg-slate-600">
        <%= user.username %>
      </span>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ul>
```

After this, we ought to handle the `cursor-move` event coming 
from the client and update the coordinates in the list of
active users in the channel with the `socket.id` as an identifier.
Change the `handle_event/1` function to this.

```elixir
  def handle_event("cursor-move", %{"mouse_x" => x, "mouse_y" => y}, socket) do
    key = socket.id
    payload = %{x: x, y: y}

    metas =
      Presence.get_by_key(@channel_topic, key)[:metas]
      |> List.first()
      |> Map.merge(payload)

    Presence.update(self(), @channel_topic, key, metas)

    {:noreply, socket}
  end
```

The last thing that is left is to make our LiveView *react*
to whenever a user joins or leaves the channel. 
Therefore, we sync the socket with the info available
in the Presence channel. The following function 
**updates the list of active users** whenever someone
joins or leaves the channel.

```elixir
  def handle_info(%{event: "presence_diff", payload: _payload}, socket) do
    users =
      Presence.list(@channel_topic)
      |> Enum.map(fn {_, data} -> data[:metas] |> List.first() end)

    updated =
      socket
      |> assign(users: users)
      |> assign(socket_id: socket.id)

    {:noreply, updated}
  end
```

That was a lot! Now let's restart the server
and open two different tabs. You will see the cursor
moving in both tabs **in real-time**. Awesome stuff!

<img width="1379" alt="multiple_users" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17494745/197518449-482a0286-f711-4890-93a4-deb0c9f7aabd.png">


## 4. Customization
Now that we got the main feature working, let's customize
our page so it looks better! :art:

Let's add a background to the page. 
We used [heropatterns.com](https://heropatterns.com/)
to create our background pattern. 
You can customize the background to your liking 
and then head to `assets/css/app.cs` and create a class
`.bg-pattern` and paste the pattern contents. 

Now, let's change the `cursors.html.heex` to add a text
and add the background. CHange the file so it looks like this:

```
<div class="bg-pattern flex justify-center items-center h-screen w-screen bg-[#eafbfa]">
  <div class="absolute pointer-events-none">
    <p class="text-[4rem] font-extrabold text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-br from-[#a7edff] to-[#ff6565] opacity-20">just use your mouse</p>
  </div>
  <ul class="list-none mt-9 max-h-full max-w-full" id="cursor" phx-hook="TrackClientCursor">
    <%= for user <- @users do %>
      <li style={"left: #{user.x}%; top: #{user.y}%"} class="flex flex-col absolute pointer-events-none whitespace-nowrap overflow-hidden">
        <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="31" height="32" fill="none" viewBox="0 0 31 32">

After restarting the server, your webpage should look like this:

### 4a. Different colors
Let's add some finishing touches. Each user will have its own 
color associated. First, let's add the 
[`random_color`](https://hexdocs.pm/random_color/RandomColor.html)
library.

```elixir
{:random_color, "~> 0.1.0"}
```

Now, in the `cursors.ex` file, the same way we generate
a random username everytime a user joins and add it to the 
socket assigns, let's do the same for the color. 
Make the necessary changes to the file so the `mount/3` function
looks like this.

```elixir
  def mount(_params, _session, socket) do

    username = MnemonicSlugs.generate_slug
    color = RandomColor.hex()

    Presence.track(self(), @channel_topic, socket.id, %{
      socket_id: socket.id,
      x: 50,
      y: 50,
      username: username,
      color: color
    })
```

Now, all that's left for us to do
is changing the `cursors.html.heex` to get the color and 
show it to the client. Change the `<span>` element
of the username and change the background color
according to the `color` assign. It should look look this:

```
<span style={"background-color: #{user.color};"} class="mt-1 ml-4 px-1 text-sm text-white rounded-xl">
  <%= user.username %>
</span>
```

And you should see a different color under each user's username.

If you want to remove the cursor pointer and just have the `svg`
element as your cursor, simply add the following piece of code
to the `assets/css/app.css` file:

```css
.body {
  cursor: none
}
```
